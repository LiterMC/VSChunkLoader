## Blocks

### Chunk Loader

*Chunk Loader* can load an area based on the server's `simulation-distance`.  
It will also load any Valkyrien Skies ship in the range.

### Weak Chunk Loader

*Weak Chunk Loader* is cheaper than *Chunk Loader*, but it can only activate for 1 minutes (or 1200 ticks).  
After that it will self-destroyed.

*Weak Chunk Loader* is very unstable, it will not drop anything if you break it.
